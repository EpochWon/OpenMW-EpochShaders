# OpenMW-EpochShaders
Vanilla+ core shader mod

Very WIP. 0.49 dev builds only

Features:
- Soft Shadows (Credits to Wareya, I didn't make them)
- Very basic indirect hemisphere lighting for ambient
- Energy conserving blinn-phong specular, only applied when there is no custom specular power detected in the texture
